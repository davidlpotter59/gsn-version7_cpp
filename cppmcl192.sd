This program defines the correct edition date for a form.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use swsut200.var for the Varibles needed.

This include was written to work with SFPNAME but can be set to anything else
with the proper fields.

You must use the include file swsut100.inc to get the correct state.
It converts the String state into a number state.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cut and paste this above the include file in the previous screen to define
the varible.

I_CODE = ""

I_CODE should be set to what form this iclude file is being
       used in: ex "BU0312 ".

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then use: Trun(SFSOPTEND:FORM_PRINT) and SFSOPTEND:EDITION_PRINT in the code
to show the correct form name and edition date.
