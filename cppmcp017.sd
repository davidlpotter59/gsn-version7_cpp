--------------------------------------------------------------
07/31/2003            DWR      Began general Layout
11/26/2003            DWR      Data entry and completion of form started - form
                               was started but only top 1/3 of first sheet was
                               formatted and no data work was done to this point
12/08/2003            DWR      Changed form to not display CPPPROPERTY totals
                               if = to CPPPROPRATE total
03/16/2015            CAC      changed some hard coded values.
